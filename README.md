# React ToDo

My first app created with React.js.

Challanges:

- <b>Destructuring</b> <br>
  It feels like React literally forces you to learn and use destructuring, which is a good thing.
- <b>Immutability</b> <br>
  One of the core concepts of React is to keep data structures immutable. The practise prevents bugs, and makes it easier to keep control of the app's state.
- <b>Concept of 'State'</b> <br>
  As someone with prior experience only in vanilla JavaScript, the concept of state is something that needs time to take adjusted to. Of course, the same concept exists in vanilla JS, but it's kind of more vague than in React.

<b>Notes: </b>

Initially made with class components without using hooks, then refactored to use hooks with arrow function based components instead.
